In this project we created class in cpp.
Class "Member" which represent Social networking user. The user can follow or unfollow other members, see after how many friends he follows and how many followers he has.
In addition, the system remembers how many active members there are in the system.
A main.cpp file was added to the main program and we added to the file several unit tests.
